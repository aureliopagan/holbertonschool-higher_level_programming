This project contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various data structure operations and manipulations. Each script is designed to perform a specific task related to data structures, particularly focusing on lists and dictionaries.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **0-square_matrix_simple.py**: Contains a function that creates a square matrix and performs operations on it.
- **0-main.py**: Main entry point for testing the functionality of `0-square_matrix_simple.py`.
  
- **1-search_replace.py**: Contains a function that searches for a specific value in a list and replaces it with another value.
- **1-main.py**: Main entry point for testing the functionality of `1-search_replace.py`.
  
- **2-uniq_add.py**: Contains a function that adds unique integers from a list.
- **2-main.py**: Main entry point for testing the functionality of `2-uniq_add.py`.
  
- **3-common_elements.py**: Contains a function that finds common elements between two lists.
- **3-main.py**: Main entry point for testing the functionality of `3-common_elements.py`.
  
- **4-only_diff_elements.py**: Contains a function that finds elements that are in one list but not in another.
- **4-main.py**: Main entry point for testing the functionality of `4-only_diff_elements.py`.
  
- **5-number_keys.py**: Contains a function that counts the number of keys in a dictionary.
- **5-main.py**: Main entry point for testing the functionality of `5-number_keys.py`.
  
- **6-print_sorted_dictionary.py**: Contains a function that prints a dictionary in sorted order.
- **6-main.py**: Main entry point for testing the functionality of `6-print_sorted_dictionary.py`.
  
- **7-update_dictionary.py**: Contains a function that updates a dictionary with new key-value pairs.
- **7-main.py**: Main entry point for testing the functionality of `7-update_dictionary.py`.
  
- **8-simple_delete.py**: Contains a function that deletes a key from a dictionary.
- **8-main.py**: Main entry point for testing the functionality of `8-simple_delete.py`.
  
- **9-multiply_by_2.py**: Contains a function that multiplies all values in a dictionary by 2.
- **9-main.py**: Main entry point for testing the functionality of `9-multiply_by_2.py`.
  
- **10-best_score.py**: Contains a function that finds the key with the highest value in a dictionary.
- **10-main.py**: Main entry point for testing the functionality of `10-best_score.py`.
  
- **11-multiply_list_map.py**: Contains a function that multiplies elements in a list using the map function.
- **11-main.py**: Main entry point for testing the functionality of `11-multiply_list_map.py`.
  
- **12-roman_to_int.py**: Contains a function that converts a Roman numeral to an integer.
- **12-main.py**: Main entry point for testing the functionality of `12-roman_to_int.py`.

## Usage

To run the tests for each script, execute the corresponding `main.py` file. Each main file is designed to demonstrate the functionality of its associated script and can be run independently.
