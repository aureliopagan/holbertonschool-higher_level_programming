🐍 Python Serialization & Marshaling Project

Welcome to our exploration of **marshaling** and **serialization**, two core concepts that enable efficient data storage and communication across systems. This project is designed to build your understanding of how data can be transformed, stored, and transmitted in real-world applications.

## 🧠 Introduction

In this project, you'll explore how data structures and object states can be efficiently transformed and communicated between components or systems. You'll work with different serialization formats and tools in Python to better understand how real applications persist, transmit, and manage data.

## 🔄 What is Marshaling?

> Marshaling is the process of transforming memory objects into a format that can be stored or transmitted over a network.

Key points:
- Converts in-memory objects into a portable format (often binary).
- Essential for **remote procedure calls (RPCs)**.
- Ensures data can be interpreted across different platforms.
- Often used in **distributed systems** and **network communication**.

## 💾 What is Serialization?

> Serialization is the process of converting data structures or object states into a format that can be saved to a file or transmitted over a network.

Key points:
- Preserves the **state of an object** for future use.
- Commonly used in:
  - Data persistence (e.g., saving app state)
  - Distributed systems
  - API data exchange (e.g., REST APIs)
- Enables objects to be **recreated exactly** in another environment.
