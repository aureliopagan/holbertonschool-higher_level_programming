## Welcome to the Python World!

You'll soon discover that with Python (and most higher-level programming languages), there are often multiple ways to solve the same problem. Some tasks may require a specific implementation, while others allow for various approaches.

Python follows a style guide called **PEP 8**, which helps maintain clean and readable code. At Holberton, we won't initially enforce PyCode (a stricter version of PEP 8), so don't worry if you encounter warnings while using PEP 8—you can safely ignore them for now.

Enjoy your Python journey!
