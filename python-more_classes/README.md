# Python - More Classes and Objects

## Resources

**Read or watch:**

- [Object Oriented Programming](#) (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))
- [Object-Oriented Programming](#)  
    *Note: In most of the following paragraphs, the author shows how you should **not** use or write a class, to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Read only these paragraphs:*  
    - “General Introduction”  
    - “First-class Everything”  
    - “A Minimal Class in Python”  
    - “Attributes”  
    - “Methods”  
    - “The `__init__` Method”  
    - “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding”  
    - “`__str__`- and `__repr__`-Methods”  
    - “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes”  
    - “Destructor”
- [Class and Instance Attributes](#)
- [classmethods and staticmethods](#)
- [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](#) (Mainly the last part: “Public instead of Private Attributes”)
- [str vs repr](#)
