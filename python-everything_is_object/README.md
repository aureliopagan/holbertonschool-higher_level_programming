# Python - Everything is Object

This project is a little bit different than the usual projects. The first part consists of questions about Python’s specificity, such as “What would be the result of…”. You should read all documentation first (as usual :)), then take the time to think and brainstorm about what you believe and why. Try to do this without coding anything for a few hours.

Trying examples in the Python interpreter will give you most of the answers without having to think about it. **Don’t go this route.** First read, then think, then brainstorm. Only then you can test in the interpreter.

It’s important that you truly understand the reasons behind the answers to all these tasks so that you can apply the same logic to other variables and other variable types.

> **Note:** During interviews for Python positions, you will most likely have to answer these types of questions.

All your answers should be only **one line** in a file. No space before or after the answer.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google**:

### General
- What is an object
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is the difference between immutable and mutable objects
- What is a reference
- What is an assignment
- What is an alias
- How to know if two variables are identical
- How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
- How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
- What is mutable and immutable
- What are the built-in mutable types
- What are the built-in immutable types
- How does Python pass variables to functions

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3` (version 3.8.5)

- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.\*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### .txt Answer Files
