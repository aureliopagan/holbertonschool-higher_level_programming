# Python - Inheritance

## Resources

Read or watch:

- Inheritance
- Multiple inheritance
- Inheritance in Python
- Learn to Program 10: Inheritance Magic Methods

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

### General

- What is a superclass, base class, or parent class
- What is a subclass
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When an instance can have new attributes
- How to inherit a class from another
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- What is the default class every class inherits from
- How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
- Which attributes or methods are available by inheritance to subclasses
- The purpose of inheritance
- When and how to use the built-in functions: `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `super`

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.\*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files should end with a new line
- All test files should be inside a folder named `tests`
- All test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`)
- All tests should be executed using: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
- Documentation must be a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (length will be verified)
- Collaboration on test cases is encouraged to cover all edge cases

## Documentation

- Do not use the words `import` or `from` inside your comments, as the checker may think you are trying to import modules
