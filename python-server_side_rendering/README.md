# Python - Server-Side Rendering

Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique where web pages are generated on the server and delivered to the client as complete HTML documents. This differs from client-side rendering, where the browser assembles the page using JavaScript and data fetched from the server. In this project, you'll learn how to implement SSR using Python and Flask, utilizing the Jinja templating engine to build dynamic, efficient, and SEO-friendly web applications.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the principles of server-side rendering and how it contrasts with client-side rendering.
- Identify the benefits of SSR in web development.
- Implement SSR in Python using the Flask framework.
- Use the Jinja templating engine to generate dynamic HTML pages.
- Read and display data from sources such as JSON, CSV, and SQLite databases.
- Manage dynamic content and user input in web applications.

## What to Expect

You will develop a Flask application that serves web pages using server-side rendering techniques. Starting with basic templates, you'll progress to integrating dynamic content from various data sources. By the end of the project, you'll have a solid understanding of SSR, templating, and building scalable, efficient web applications.
